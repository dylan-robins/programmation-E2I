# Programmation - E2I

## What is this?

This is a repository containing all the programs I’ve written for my various programming classes during my E2I course. It’s intended mainly as a backup in case anything happens to my computer, but if it’s useful to you that’s great.

## Compiling

The programs included in this repository can all be compiled by running `make all` in the toplevel directory. For this you’ll need recent versions of gcc and gmake installed. Each program will be compiled to a `./bin/` directory relative to the location of the source file.
